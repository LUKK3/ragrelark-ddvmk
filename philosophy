PHILOSOPHY

GENERAL
* Slow advancement.
	You are not fighting giant demons and dragons by the end of the game. In late game, earlier monsters should still pose a threat.
	Skill improvement should still be useful and interesting, just with less improvement.
* Avoidence of grinding.
	Perfectly limited XP each level.
	Anything that can be reused should not be permanent. Redundant time sinks should be avoided.
* Replayability.
	Since the beginning of the game is played more than the end, it should be more diverse.
	Thanks to slow advancement, any added thing can be useful at all points in the game.
* Particular skill training less important.
	If you train the wrong skill at the beginning, it should be easy to remedy with little drawback.
* Less focus on combat.
	Non-combat related activities should be as complex and interesting as combat related ones.
	Combat and non-combat should tie together well.
